# qoute Portal — MVP 1.0 (Reduced) _with Agency Onboarding_
Lean, document‑driven workflow focusing on **Supplier ↔ Agency** engagement. No line‑item parsing or compliance vault in Phase I.

---

## 1) Goals & Scope
**Goal:** Enable agencies to discover suppliers and run RFQs; enable suppliers to maintain profiles and respond with **PDF quotations**; enable admins to bootstrap the ecosystem (categories, suppliers, agencies).

**In‑scope (Phase I)**
- Supplier onboarding & profile (incl. ID image) + services listing
- **Agency onboarding & profile**
- Admin management of **categories**, suppliers, and agencies
- Agency: supplier directory browsing + contact details
- Agency: RFQ creation & sending (document‑driven brief)
- Supplier: RFQ inbox & **PDF quotation** submission
- Basic email notifications (invites, submissions)

**Out‑of‑scope (later phases)**
- Compliance vault, line‑item quote parsing
- Payments/escrow, analytics, negotiation chat, SSO, contracts/e‑sign

---

## 2) Roles, Orgs & Permissions
- **Admin**
  - Create/edit **categories**
  - Create suppliers & agencies (manual onboarding)
  - Disable/enable orgs and users
- **Agency (Org + Users)**
  - **Agency Admin:** manage agency profile, invite teammates
  - **Agency Member:** browse directory, create/send RFQs, view submissions
- **Supplier (Org + Users)**
  - **Supplier Admin:** manage supplier profile, services, ID image
  - **Supplier Member:** view RFQs, submit/replace quotations (PDF)

> _Note_: Each user belongs to **0 or 1 org** (`agency` or `supplier`). Admin users belong to no customer org.
